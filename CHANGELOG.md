## 0.1.0
Initial setup of a DBL-wide rubocop config, to be used in all projects if applicable.
Please:
* adhere to proper versioning
* GitHub releases (we can publish a private package) => nicer for Dependabot
* keep a meaningful Changelog
* keep the README up-to-date, so we can copy-paste a "production-ready" snippet from the README to any project
